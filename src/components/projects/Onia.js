      <p>In 2010 a friend of my sister's, Carl, started a small, high-end, men's swimsuit company in NYC called <em>Onia</em>. After graduating from college in the spring of 2011 I started helping Carl out, mostly with website and marketing/communications design stuff. We enjoyed working together so a few months later I started working for Carl full time. Over the next two years I helped shape the brand. I designed swimsuits and other products, art directed photoshoots & popup shops, desiged packaging & collateral, created mood boards, marketing materials, designed and redesigned the website, and more. I was the only designer working on Onia at the time. The brand is still around and is doing well.</p>
